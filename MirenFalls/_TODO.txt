Hello Hello! Here's my TODO list that I think is a good idea if we remember to keep this updated I'll start ^-^

---------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
-Streamline a format for the TODO file beacuse formatting is nice

-Determine which PerlinNoise function is more efficient (ImprovedNoise vs Noise2D)

-Write more code docs because I didn't do any of that lol (sorry)

-Fix Utils.cs

-Name and define "tile assets" (multi-tiles) because I don't know what to call them and it's bothering me

-Better organize skeleton? I think the skeleton isn't bad but you're right now an outsider so LMK if there's anything that can be improved... it's a bit annoying to improve though
because visual studio doesn't refactor the namespace when moving files (from what I can tell) basically, if you do end up moving it make sure you fix the namespace and then errors in the compiler
